## Problem 1: Breast Cancer Classification Using SVM and PCA

### Overview
This analysis focuses on classifying breast cancer data using Support Vector Machines (SVM) enhanced by Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The dataset is prepared by splitting it into training and testing sets and scaling the features.

### Key Steps
1. **Data Preparation**: 
   - The breast cancer dataset is loaded.
   - Features are standardized using `StandardScaler()`.

2. **Model Evaluation**: 
   - A function evaluates model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall.

3. **Optimal Number of Principal Components**:
   - PCA is applied to reduce dimensionality.
   - An SVM classifier is trained and evaluated across different numbers of components.

4. **Kernel Comparison**:
   - Various SVM kernels are tested to find the best performing model.

5. **Logistic Regression Comparison**:
   - A Logistic Regression model is compared with the best SVM model.
